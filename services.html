        <p class = "generalParagraph">We use spikeless climbing techniques and try to make cuts that are few, small, and fast healing. More generally, we respect the gudelines of ISA's Best Management Practices: Tree Purnning(2008) and the associated ANSI standards.</p>
   <h3>Tree Removals</h3>
        <p class = "generalParagraph">While pruning and tree health care practices help us to reduce the need for removals in general, there are times when a tree simply must be removed. </p>
        <p class = "generalParagraph">Some removals require bucket trucks, cranes, and heavy equipment, but most usually just need a skilled climber. To steer a tree's fall, we can attach lines high in its canopy; properly rigged, a smaller tree can often be lowered to the ground using only ropes, friction devices, and the proper cuts. Over delicate areas we can remove a tree section by section: tossing, lowering, swinging, or zip-lining each piece away as necessary. Balancing efficiency, safety, and cost, we will find the best strategy to meet your concerns - whether great care must be taken around prized azaleas, or you simply need a hazard tree directed away from your house.</p>
        <p class = "generalParagraph">Rates depend on the labor and the equipment required. Wood can be hauled away; brush can be chipped (and removed, or left on site). For each circumstance we are happy to suggest a range of alternatives with corresponding costs to meet your specific needs.</p>
   <h3>Tree Risk Assessment</h3>
        <p class = "generalParagraph">We also offer risk assessment on your trees. You can have a verbal risk assessment during a 45 minute appoitnment with one of our certified arborist.
            If you are selling your house, call for an appointment and can 
            have a written Assessment for your due dilligence. Those who want a written assessment along with their walk-through property visit with our arborist will have an additional fee.
            Call our office for more details.
