    <h1>Meet our Team</h1>
    <h2>Craig</h2>
        <p class = "generalParagraph">He is a certified arborist and a graduate of UCLA and Harvard. He is passionate about the tree health and safe climbing.
            His interests in trees began in his childhood in a family farm aiding with pollination of date palms. 
            The origin of the Treeist comes when he decided to take on a tree in his own backyard. He wanted to learn how to cut down a tree himself
            in order to increase sunlight for his tomato garden. With the knowledge he has gained in tree health, climbing, and safe tree removal, a small team followed him.
